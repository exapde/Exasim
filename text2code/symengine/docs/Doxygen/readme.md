# SymEngine C++ API Documentation
C++ application protocol interface bindings for SymEngine, the FOSS symbolic math library.

This is the API documentation; meant for advanced users or developers (at any stage) who would like to get a more in-depth understanding of the code-base.

New users should start with the tutorials and content at [SymEngine.org](https://symengine.org)

Though the documentation is largely at the main site, the following files are also present[^1] :

- [The C\+\+ Style Guide](md/style_guide.md)
- [The Doxygen Style Guide](md/doc_guide.md)

It **is expected** that [the Code Design Philosophy](https://symengine.org/design/design.html) has been understood.

[^1]: These are relevant to the intended audience (developers)
