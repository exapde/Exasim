* About
- These files are *not* used in any of the HTML generated from this repository.
- They are here to ensure the tutorials do not break
  - These are run by the CI with [[https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/papermill-cli.html][papermill]]
** Adding
- Always use the environment of the [[https://github.com/symengine/symengine.github.io][tutorial repository]]
- We use ~papermill~ to determine which version is required to run the code blocks
- We also *do not* store any ~.ipynb~ files and each executable tutorial has the ~.myst.md~ extension
- Update the *.md* files to point to the new tutorial otherwise it will not be built
  - It will still be tested
** Visualizing
For details on how to display these go to the [[https://github.com/symengine/symengine.github.io][tutorial repository]].
